Discussion about next steps for the XR-IT backend and updates from Arjo on plug-in.

1. Node + Plugin startup
	1. Plugin will establish communication with node (this will be the exception to the service discover route)
	   
2. Node + Plugin configuration + communication
	1. Arjo will determine the configuration requirements that he needs to setup streaming requirements in LiveLink, MVN, etc. and then communicate those requirements to me.
